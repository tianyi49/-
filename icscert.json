This could potentially reduce the impact to other devices on the hospital network.Users of the Alaris PC unit model 8015 should upgrade to the latest Alaris PC unit software to reduce associated risks.\tBD will address this vulnerability through an upcoming version of the BD Alaris PC Unit software, pending 510(k) clearance.Users are advised to follow procedures for clearing wireless network authentication credentials on the Alaris PCU if the device is to be removed from service or it will not be in control of institutional staff. These procedures are outlined in the Alaris System Maintenance Software User Manual (page 13). Properly clearing wireless network authentication credentials is recommended when emergency patient transport is imminent, or when a device may be out of staff control.Users are advised to change their wireless network authentication credentials regularly, and immediately if there is evidence of unauthorized physical access to an Alaris device at their facility. Additionally, all wireless credentials should be cleared prior to transferring an Alaris device to another facility. Where feasible, users are encouraged to utilize enterprise-grade authentication methods, (e.g., EAP-TLS).Users are strongly encouraged to consider security policy in which wireless credentials are not configured for the Alaris PCU if wireless networking functionality is not being utilized for operation. This will remediate the vulnerability for non-wireless users.If requesting the Alaris PCU to be enabled in FIPS mode, users are advised to implement a policy of placing tamper-evident seals on the rear access panel and on the grooves of both sides of the Alaris PCU.Users may choose to implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) that restrict device access to specific media access control (MAC) and IP addresses, ports, protocols, and services.Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.

This address may be one or more of the IP, machine name, or domain name where the secure gateway is hosted. The address may also be that of a load balancer or proxy, if the secure gateway is deployed that way.Configure the secure gateway’s whitelists to restrict access to expected client IPs, as well as to restrict access from the secure gateway to only expected internal server hosts. For an additional defense-in-depth layer, users can further use the Windows OS-level firewall (or zone firewalls) to restrict communication among only the expected nodes.If using self-signed certificates, configure the secure gateway machine to trust the server certificate.Depending on the organization’s requirements, users can further configure the secure gateway to restrict the usable TLS protocols. For an additional defense-in-depth layer, TLS protocols and cipher suites can also be restricted at the operating system level through the use of third party tools such as IISCrypto.Create unique user accounts with minimal privileges dedicated to accessing applications remotely. OS group policy objects can be used to further restrict what those unique user accounts are allowed to do.
